### AGGM Syntax

Aggm syntax can be anything, from descriptions, emojis, or pseudo-code. Here are some examples:

```
A video-game where the player is blue. 
Controls are:
- W to move up
- A to move left
- S to move down
- D to move right
```

AGGM works by using [AggmGPT](https://github.com/Adolfo-GM/AggmGPT-2) to interpret and execute your code.
Your data is never sent to a server in the cloud, and is always kept private and on your local machine.
